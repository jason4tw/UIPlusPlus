# UIPlusPlus
 UI++

Initial public open-source code release: December 14, 2024

This is all of the UI++ source code in all of its glory and the result of my hardwork over the past 15 or so years and now available for you to do whatever you want with it. It's been more than two years since I last built this solution so I really don't remember everything but will happily help and aid in anyway that I can to help UI++ continue to exist and help those that need it.

Short brain dump of what's required:
- Visual Studio 2022
- Visual C++ with MFC static libraries
- [vcpkg with MSBuild integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild?pivots=shell-powershell#1---set-up-vcpkg)
- The binaries (FTWCMLog.dll, FTWldap.dll, and UI++.exe) will get dumped into the appropriate sub-folder of the solution Build folder.

Please reach out if you have questions, concerns, comments, or need help.
